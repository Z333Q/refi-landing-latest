      "custody": {
        "question": "Do you take custody?",
        "answer": "No. Your assets remain in your brokerage account at all times. ReFi.Trading agents execute trades through read-only API connections, ensuring you maintain full control and ownership of your funds."
      },
      "brokers": {
        "question": "Which brokers are supported?",
        "answer": "We currently support Interactive Brokers, TD Ameritrade, E*TRADE, Charles Schwab, and Fidelity. Additional broker integrations are added based on user demand and technical compatibility."
      },
      "agents": {
        "question": "How do agents decide to trade?",
        "answer": "Our ReFinity© agents use ensemble reinforcement learning (PPO, TD3, RVI-Q) with reward centering and MetaOptimize tuning. They continuously adapt to market conditions while respecting your predefined risk parameters."
      },
      "risk": {
        "question": "What risk controls are enforced?",
        "answer": "Every trade must pass a zero-knowledge proof verification before execution. This includes Value-at-Risk (VaR) limits, position sizing constraints, and drawdown caps that you set. No trade can violate these mathematically proven limits."
